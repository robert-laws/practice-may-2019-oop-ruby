# Object-Oriented Programming - Ruby

## Key Concepts

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## Key Principles

* Single responsibility principle - a class should have one responsibility only
* Open/closed principle
* Liskov substitution principle
* Interface segregation principle
* Dependency inversion principle
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
* YAGNI - Don't over abstract
* Code Smell - code issue that indicates a problem

## Testing

* Unit tests
* Systems tests

## Design Patterns

* Templates to structure your code in a specific way
* ex. Factory Method Pattern - uses factory methods to deal with creating objects
* ex. Memento Pattern - provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state
